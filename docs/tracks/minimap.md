# Minimap
Create a new `minimap.png` file using your favourite graphics editor.

There are two options for making a minimap. The outcome is identical.

## Format
* Image size of 32x32 to 128x128
  * Odd sizes like 64x32 or 128x64 is fine.
  * Recommend no bigger than 128x128 but it will work.
  * Save as 32-bit

## Tips
* Turn off anti-aliasing
* White pixels must be RGB(255, 255, 255)
* Black pixels must be RGB(0, 0, 0)
* Any other pixel colour will turn into white

## Option 1: Black Background, White Track
* Use black pixels for the background and white pixels for the track.
* The black pixels will be transparent in-game

* Easiest option to make because it is easy to see the track


## Option 2: Transparent Background, White Track
* Transparent pixels must be *FULL* transparent or they will turn into white pixels

<img width=64 src="image-5.png" />

* Transparent version much harder to see the track in the graphics editor.

## Export
Place `minimap.png` in the track folder.
```
desktop/mycoolmods/tracks/mytrackname/minimap.png
```
The same folder as the track data that looks like this:

<img width="289" height="466" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ccef558b-ac9a-42ed-bc85-e27da4f16598" />

## In-game configuration

* In the minimap tab the position of the minimap, finishline, and players markers can be configured.
* The minimap can also be coloured
